I'm a developer who likes C#, Node.js, vim, Python and all things nerdy. 
 During the day I work for [SMS M&T](http://www.smsmt.com) and in my off time I hack on my side projects.
Recently I've started blogging as a way to keep track of the fun things I get up to with code in my time off.

I'm also incredibly gifted... [http://soundcloud.com/liveranga](http://soundcloud.com/liveranga)
