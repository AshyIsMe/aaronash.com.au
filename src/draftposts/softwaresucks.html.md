# Software Sucks

List my regular software annoyances here.

Separate them out by OS and software company.


## Windows Server 2012
A fucking touch interface on a server OS?


## OSX 
Why does the whole gui of OSX freeze every now and then when Time Machine spins up my usb drive?


## Microsoft Office on Mac
- Lync is terrible
-- Crashes often, especially when switching audio devices
-- The historical conversation interface is terrible
- Word - wtf is with not using mac hotkeys for simple things?
- Outlook - Best of a bad bunch but still crashes often

- Outlook - Open an excel attachment directly from an email. Make some changes. File -> Save As:
          - "untitled.xls"  <- Why the fuck doesn't this default to the name of the existing document?  You then have to manually type the fucking name aorecugraectouhnsatodheusnth
- Outlook - Can't open a *.msg file on mac.
          - Seriously wtf: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36508/opening-msg-file-in-outlook-for-mac-2011
          - Oh yeap, email rules aren't safe either:

## Spotify
- Why does my mouse back button skip back a track when im always trying to just browse back a page?
