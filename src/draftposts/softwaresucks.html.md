# Software Sucks

List my regular software annoyances here.

Separate them out by OS and software company.


## Windows Server 2012
A fucking touch interface on a server OS?


## OSX 
Why does the whole gui of OSX freeze every now and then when Time Machine spins up my usb drive?


## Microsoft Office on Mac
- Lync is terrible
-- Crashes often, especially when switching audio devices
-- The historical conversation interface is terrible
- Word - wtf is with not using mac hotkeys for simple things?
- Outlook - Best of a bad bunch but still crashes often



## Spotify
- Why does my mouse back button skip back a track when im always trying to just browse back a page?
